# Gender-Age-Detection
Final year project to predict age and gender for an image.
This is a Machine Learning project used to make predictions for age and gender from an image by analysing the face of a person.
The dataset used for this project is an csv. file where the images have been transformed to pixels so the code efficiency is increased.
You can download the dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nipunarora8/age-gender-and-ethnicity-face-data-csv.
The project is divided into 3 parts: -main.py where the are graphs and informations about the dataset,
                                     -train.py where our models are being trained and saved,
                                     -detect.py where you can make predictions on specific images or on a real one by using the web camera.
